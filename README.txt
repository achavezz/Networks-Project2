As most of my code was from the book, when priting both the HELLO and BYE messages, I created a Test file where I used the same code. 
I created examples that would try and attempt to print messages that either did/did not follow the protocool.
Once I saw that my test cases where working, I copied it over to my server file and attempt to run the code.
I found success in being able to receive both the HELLO and BYE messages as well as sending the ACK message.
